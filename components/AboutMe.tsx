      My name is Sofia Goryunova. I am 19 y.o. I study at Innopolis University
      from 2023 year. I became interested in programming in 3rd grade when
      started attending a programming club. The first programming language that
      I was lucky enough to learn was QBasic. Then at 9 grade I decided to
      become a professional programmer and started to prepare for exams. That
      was the moment when I learned Python. I also take a lot of courses such as
      2D games on python, data science on python, web development courses, etc.
